## How It Works

Smooth Relocations is built on a robust backend and user-friendly frontend. Here's how the project works:

### Backend
1. **Data Management**: The backend manages data related to customers, their requests, and the availability of relocation services. It stores information about pricing and service options.

2. **Chat Support**: Real-time chat support is powered by a chatbot integrated with a customer service team. This allows customers to inquire about services, pricing, and more.

3. **Pricing Calculation**: Pricing is calculated based on various factors, including the type of relocation (residential or commercial), distance, number of items, and additional services such as packing.

4. **Customized Services**: The backend provides options for customization based on customer needs. This includes special requirements and unique service requests.

### Frontend
1. **User Interface**: The frontend offers a user-friendly interface for customers to explore the range of services provided by Smooth Relocations.

2. **Chat Integration**: The chat feature allows users to initiate conversations with the customer support team or the chatbot for quick answers to their queries.

3. **Pricing Estimation**: Users can get an estimate of the cost of their relocation based on the information they provide. This helps them plan their budget effectively.
